# Notes

## Week 12 - Network Security Protocols

### SSL/TLS

> **Secure Sockets Layer** (or SSL for short) is a security protocol that creates an ecnrypted link between a web server and a web browser. It was later upgraded to the **Transport Layer Security** (or TLS for short) protocol, which fixed existing vulnerabilities in SSL.

#### Architecture

* **TLS connection -** A transient peer-to-peer connection where a service is provided. It is associated with exactly <ins>one session</ins>.
* **TLS session -** An association between a client and a server which consists in a set of negotiated <ins>cryptography parameters</ins>. It is reused across <ins>multiple connections</ins>, in order to avoid expensive negotiation stages.

#### Protocols

TLS is built on top of several **protocols**, as the protocol stack above demonstrates:

**Note:** Since it is a layered structure, protocols on top rely on those below them.

* **Record protocol**

![Alt text](images/12-2.png)

* **Handshake protocol**

This protocol is used before any application data is transmitted. It consists in a series of messages exchanged between server and client which allow them to:

1. Mutually **authenticate**.
2. Negotiate **encryption** and **MAC** algorithms.
3. Negotiate cryptographic **keys**.

It is comprised of the following phases:

* **Change Cipher Spec protocol**

Consists of a single message of one byte, whose value is either 0 or 1. It is a confirmation message whose sole purpose is to cause the pending **state** to become the current state.

* **Alert protocol**

This protocol details how to send alert messages, that is, important messages about the state of the TLS connection. Depending on the severity of the issue, the messages can be classified as **fatal** (eg: incorrect MAC) or **non-fatal**.

Each message has two bytes - the first relays the **severity**, while the second specifies the **issue**.

* **Heartbeat protocol**

A **periodic signal** is generated by hardware or software to indicate normal operation or to synchronize with other parts of a system. It is typically used to monitor the availability of a protocol entity.

This protocol has two types of messages - `HEARTBEAT_REQUEST`, used to ask whether a machine is alive, and `HEARTBEAT_RESPONSE`, used to respond to the former.

## Week 13 - Network Security Threats and Countermeasures

### Denial-of-Service (DoS)

> **Denial-of-Service** is a form of attack which compromises the availability of services. It is often done in a distributed fashion (<ins>DDoS</ins>).

The following **resource categories** can be attacked using DoS:

* **Network bandwidth**
* **System resources**
    * Aims to overload or crash the network handling software.
* **Application resources**
    * Done by sending several <ins>requests</ins> to a server within the target system. If each request consumes significant resources, the server responseability is jeopardized.

#### Attacks

There are several DoS attacks, namely:

* **Flooding ping**

This attack overwhelms the capacity of the **network connection** to the victim organization. This can be achieved, for instance, by spamming the victim.

The more computers that spam the network connection, the better the results of the attack. Hence, **botnets** are commonly used for this purpose.

> A **botnet** is a network of computers infected with malicious software (a.k.a. malware) that allows them to be controlled by an external entity.

* **Reflection**

Occurs when an attacker sends packets to a known service on the intermediary with a **spoofed** source address on the actual victim, thus causing the intermediary to respond to the victim.

The objective is to generate enough volumes of packets to flood the link to the target system without alerting the intermediary.

**Examples:**

| Attack | Description | Figure |
|:------:|-----------|:--------:|
| Echo-Chargen | Attack that exploits the `CharGen` service to send huge amounts of data to a victim. | ![Alt text](images/13-2.png)|
| Smurf | The attacker sends a spoofed broadcast packet to flood the victim with echo responses. | ![Alt text](images/13-3.png)|
| DNS Amplification | The attacker sends spoofed DNS request packets with the victim's IP address as the source. This exploits the fact that DNS requests tend to produce very large responses. | ![Alt text](images/13-4.png)|

### Firewalls

> A **firewall** is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic.

#### Types

* **Packet filter**

Operates at the **network layer** by observing IP packets and assessing their importance. It is configured via **Access Control Lists** (or ACLs for short).

![Alt text](images/13-5.png)

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| Speed | Stateless |
| Simplicity | Vulnerable to attacks on **TPC/IP** bugs |
| Transparency | Cannot see **TCP** connections |
| - | Unknowing of application data and context |

* **Stateful packet filter**

A **stateful** packet filter that operates at the **transport layer**. It remembers **TCP** connections and can even remember **UDP** packets.

![Alt text](images/13-6.png)

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| Can do everything a packet filter can | Lacks internal application logic |
| Keeps track of ongoing connections | Slower than packet filtering |
| Relies on protocol logic to detect misbehaviors | - |

* **Application proxy**

A packet filter which looks at incoming application data and verifies it is safe before allowing passage. It operates at the **application** and **transport layers**.

![Alt text](images/13-7.png)

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| Has a complete view of connections and application data | Slower than the stateful packet filtering |
| Can filter bad data at application level | Requires each application to have their own proxy code |

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

> An **Intrusion Detection System** (or IDS for short) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

#### Types

* **Host-based -** monitor activities on <ins>hosts</ins>

![Alt text](images/13-8.png)

* **Network-based -** monitor activity at selected points of the <ins>network</ins> for known attacks.

![Alt text](images/13-9.png)

#### Methodologies

* **Signature detection**
    * Requires a set of malicious data patterns or attack rules.
    * Only identifies known attacks for which it has patterns or rules.
* **Anomaly detection**
    * Invloves the collection of user data relating to the behaviour of legitimate users.
    * Observed behaviour is analysed to determine whether it matches a legitimate user or an intruder.
